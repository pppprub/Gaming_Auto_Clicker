CrossFire farming python script. (not only for gaming, but also for slacking)

# How to use: 
**Step 1:** install "pyautogui" package.

**Step 3:** open the game as windowed mode and place the window approximately at the middle of the screen (adjust the window to the right position since the auto-click will automatically click the "join" button on the right bottom)
